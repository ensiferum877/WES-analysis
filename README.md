# PCA on Genotype Calls derived from Exome Sequencing on data from Healthy Subjects and PD Patients

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where I illustrate the processing of whole exome sequencing (WES) data to apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on numerized genotype calls obtained. The dataset used for this purposes contains WES data derived from healthy individuals and patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD).

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to being able to visualize WES data ang being able to explore wheter genomic variants are sufficient to separate subjects based on their disease states (healthy, PD). The notebook walks through the data preprocessing steps, including quality control and filtering of genotype calls, followed by the application conversion of gneotype calls into a numeric matrix to be used as an input for PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data and being able to visualize this data in 2D

## Methods

- Quality Control
- Variant Allele Frequency Calculation
- PCA Implementation



## Results

The PCA results are visualized in the notebook, showing the distribution of genetic variation across the  groups.

Feel free to explore the notebook to see the step-by-step process and the insights derived from this analysis.
